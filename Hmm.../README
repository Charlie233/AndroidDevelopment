What we did:
*********************
1) We implemented all of the database operations in the util package.
	a) Not all tables require all CRUD operations. Some records are not
	updatable. 
	b) Some util classes have overridden methods that select rows from
	the database through different coulmns. 
	c) Every *Util class extends DatabaseConnector, which in turns extends the 
	abstract class DatabaseConnectorBase. It is responsible for opening
	and closing the connection. It also implements the DatabaseConstants 
	interface.
	d) All of the util methods are tested and working as expected.
2) We set up a server with MySQL running.
	a) We created a database and all the tables in our Database Schema.
	b) We populated the tables with some dummy data. 
3) We can now remotely connect to our database and populate our pages using
the contents in the database. 
	a) All of the pages now have real data (well...real fake data) from the
	actual database in our server.
4) We are able to login through the login page as admins or users through
accounts stored in corresponding tables.
	a) The contents of the page are dynamically created and populated.
	As an example, if you log in as a user, you will not see the "Add Course"
	button in the ListCourses page since that is an administrator feature. 
5) We finish Course Revew part
	a) Course Review list finshed
	b) Course Revew add finished
	c) Course Review save as draft finished
	d) Course Review search finished
	e) Course Review resume from a draft finished
6) We finish Faculty Revew part
	a) Faculty Review list finshed
	b) Faculty Revew add finished
	c) Faculty Review save as draft finished
	d) Faculty Review search finished
	e) Faculty Review resume from a draft finished
7) We finished the other user features
	a) List of my drafts
	b) List of my reviews
	c) List of courses
	d) List of faculties
	e) Change his/her settings
	f) sign up as a new user
8) We finished the other admin features
	a) Add a new course/faculty
	b) Delete a new course/faculty
	c) List of users
	d) View the usersâ€™ profiles
9) We implemented a servlet to provide web service and push notifications

Setup:

1) The project files are self-contained and no additional setup is necessary
once the project is imported into Android Studio.
2) The project should be emulated using a Nexus 7 (1200x1920) tablet.

	username: chao
